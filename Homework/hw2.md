## Homework #2 題目

1.	[P5-1] A computer has 64 MB of memory. Each word is 4 bytes. How many bits are needed to address each single word in memory?

2.	[P5-3] An imaginary computer has 16 data registers (R0 to R15), 1024 words in memory, and 16 different instructions (add, subtract, and so on). What is the minimum size of an add instruction in bits if a typical instruction uses the following format:  *add M R2.*

3.	[P5-5] What is the size of the instruction register in the computer in P5-3?

4.	[P5-6] What is the size of the program counter in the computer in P5-3?

5.	[P5-11] A computer uses memory-mapped I/O addressing. The address bus uses ten lines (10 bits). If memory is made up of 1000 words, how many four-register controllers can be accessed by the computer?

6.	[P5-12] Using the instruction set of the simple computer in Section 5.8, write the code for a program that performs the following calculation: D -> A + B + C, in which A, B, C, and D are integers in two’s complement format. The user types the values of A, B, and C, and the value of D is displayed on the monitor. 

7.	[P5-13] Using the instruction set of the simple computer, write the code for a program that performs the following calculation: B  <-  A + 3, A and 3 are integers in two’s complement format. The user types the value of A and the value of B is displayed on the monitor. (Hint: use the increment instruction.)

8.	[P5-15] Using the instruction set of the simple computer in Section 5.8, write the code for a program that adds n integers typed on the keyboard and displays their sum.  You need first to type the value of n. (Hint: use decrement and jump instructions and repeat the addition n times.)
